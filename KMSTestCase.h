/**
 Base class for unit tests that use KMSServer.
 
 This class simplfies the setup and execution of KMSServer unit tests.
 
 It's not the only way to use the KMSServer class, but if you're happy to load 
 responses from a JSON file, it makes things simple.
 
 The basic format for a test using this class is:
 
 - (void)testSomething
 {
    if ([self setupServerWithScheme:@"ftp" responses:@"ftp"])
    {
        // make your network request here
 
        [self runUntilPaused];

        // test your results here
    }
 }

 Your network request should ensure that it calls [self pause] from its delegate method or completion callback.
 The runUntilPaused call will sit pumping the current run loop until this happens - which is what gives the
 networking code that you're testing time to do its thing.
